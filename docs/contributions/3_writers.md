# Text and Translations

This area covers how to use your writing skills to make contributions to BetterVoting.

This includes adding documentation, updating the text on the website, or adding translations.

All of this can be done using only the GitHub web interface (no need to learn any programming tools!). So start with GitHub 101, then you can proceed to the relevant writing work you're interested in.
